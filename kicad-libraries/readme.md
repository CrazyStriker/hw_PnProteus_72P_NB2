.lib schematic symbol (still usually multiple symbols in one file)

.kicad_mod PCB footprint in KiCad 4+ format (looks like usually one footprint in one file)

.mod - PCB footprint prior to KiCad 4 (could be multiple footprints in one file)

.net is technically not a true source file since it's produced from .sch schematics but
   InteractiveHtmlBOM likes to use these files as input. Open question how does InteractiveHtmlBOM use these .net files exactly?
